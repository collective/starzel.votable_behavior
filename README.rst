Votable Behavior
================

*collective.votable_behavior* is part of the training story of 'Mastering Plone Development' on https://training.plone.org/.
The training story takes the use case of selecting talk and training submissions for a conference.

*collective.votable_behavior* adds the feature for registered users to vote for talks and trainings.
It started as a Plone Classic Add-On and is still valuable for Plone Classic with its viewlet for voting and reviewing.
The Add-On evolved to a Plone REST API provider for **Mastering Plone Development** roundtrip story on how to join backend and frontend if 
Plone REST API does not fit your needs, because you need more elaborated info from your backend.
